TITLE: Icing occurrence for wind energy over sea and land, from spatial statistics to long-term correction

OUTLINE:
The project investigates the occurrence and impact of icing conditions over a range of cold climates. It begins with assessment of the relevance of icing offshore (e.g., Gulf of Bothnia). Spatial gradients and distribution patterns will be examined, both off- and on-shore. If no significant offshore icing is found, the analysis will instead focus on the spatial gradient distribution in onshore wind farms located in cold climates. Subsequently, a long-term correction of limited-time datasets (e.g., 1–3 years of measurements) will be conducted.

To conduct the research, datasets and models from NEWA-IceBlade and EMD’s icing tools will be applied and systematically compared.

The project can include multiple research paths, in order of priority:

1. identification and statistical characterization of icing occurrence offshore;

2. analysis of spatial gradients towards uncertainty;

3. long-term correction and scaling of limited datasets in different cold climates;

4. comparison of different regional icing model datasets, NEWA-IceBlade and EMD-icing.

STEPS:

- Check if ther is icing:
Is it a site under icing conditions? it should be >10 g/h and >0.1 kg/m. Compute how much icing is happening with Makkonen
Compute ice load, o mass of ice on blades [kg/m]

Questions:

Explain the difffernt methos to compute accretion
What is winter number
